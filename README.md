# Smart-Straw-Machine
It is a production machine designed to make straws faster, more consistently, and with less human intervention. Some models are built for paper straws, while others are for straw applicators that place straws onto drink cartons or cups.

Smart Straw Machine

Introduction

The Smart Straw Machine is an automated system designed to release drinking straws using sensors and motorized mechanisms. The machine detects a user’s hand or object and automatically dispenses a straw safely and efficiently.
Features:

- Automatic straw dispensing

- Ultrasonic sensor detection

- Servo motor mechanism

- Touchless operation

- Compact and easy-to-use design

- Components Used:

- SG90 Servo Motor

- Arduino Nano

- Ultrasonic Sensor

- Power Supply

- Conveyor System

How It Works:

1.The machine detects a hand or material using the ultrasonic sensor.

2.Distance is calculated using the formula: distance=duration×0.034/15cm

3.When an object is detected within the set distance, the servo motor automatically activates.

4.The internal mechanism moves and prepares the straw.

5.Straws are released through the opening.

Objectives:

- To create a touchless straw dispensing system

- To improve convenience and hygiene

- To demonstrate automation using Arduino technology

Future Improvements:

- LCD display monitoring

- Mobile app integration

- Faster dispensing mechanism

- Battery backup system

Pseudocode

START

Initialize TRIG_PIN as OUTPUT Initialize ECHO_PIN as INPUT Initialize SERVO_PIN

Attach servo motor to SERVO_PIN Set servo position to CLOSED (0 degrees)

LOOP forever:

Send ultrasonic pulse from TRIG_PIN
Read echo signal from ECHO_PIN

Compute distance:
    distance = duration * 0.034 / 2

Display distance on serial monitor

IF distance > 0 AND distance <= 15 THEN
    Move servo to OPEN position (130 degrees)
    Wait for OPEN_DELAY
ELSE
    Move servo to CLOSED position (0 degrees)
ENDIF

Wait for LOOP_DELAY
END LOOP

END
